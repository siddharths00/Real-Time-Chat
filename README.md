# Real-Time-Chat
[Chat App](https://5ed29ee4987c7a85c8356fae--gifted-hoover-3572c8.netlify.app)


This is a real time chat application that aims to, in a way, replicate the working of big chatting applications. I've designed the UI using React and used socket.io so that I can
make channels or rooms, where people can communicate. You can test the functionality yourself by opening the website in 2 windows in your preferred browser. After that, all you have to do is to enter your name and the room that you want to join in one window, in the other window, write a new name but the same room name. All the members of this particular room will be able to see the messages that you type and similarly, you will be able to see the messages that they type. Coversation is possible only between members of the same room. If you want to run the project on your local machine, all you have to do is open up the client and the server folders in 2 different command prompt windows. Then type the command `npm start` in both and then wait for the server to start. Hoping that everything works perfectly and there are no dependency issues, the application should start working. 


The front end of the website is deployed on netlify and the backend exists on a heroku server.
